DOS Executable Header OPTimizer

This simple program (1) reduces unused space in the header of DOS
executable that is typically generously allocated by a linker (at least
TLINK is known to allocate not less than 512 bytes for the header,
though the minimum required size is in fact can be as small as 32 bytes)
and (2) allows injection of arbitrary metadata into the header.

N.B. I don't know if it's important for relocation entries in the header
to be aligned somehow, so the program doesn't care about alignment.
If you care, you can do manual alignment using appropriate size for
metadata.

Such utility is bound to be already existing, but today, when I needed
it, I couldn't find any but FILE SCANNER by SMT/SMF which happened to
be a Win32 only application, not a pure DOS program I was looking for.

I use Turbo C 2.0 and its make for building the program.

If you want to build it for *nix use GCC/GNU Make and Makefile.nix.
